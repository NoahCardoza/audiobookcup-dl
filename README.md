# audiobookcup-dl

At the moment this is just a **simple** script to download audio books easily from audiobookcup.com.

## Usage

Using Python 3.9, running this script is as easy as:

```bash
python main.py "<url>"
```

## Future

If I end up using this a lot or people find this and would like features added, here are some ideas:
  + add to pypi as a command line install
  + more verbose cli
  + progress bar for download
  + automatically adding cover art to mp3s
